# AI test data generation

The material in this sample shows how to use [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) to create test data for quality and harms tests in Business Central.

See

- the [QualityData](QualityData/README.md) directory for how to create test data for quality (e.g., accuracy) tests
- the [HarmsData](HarmsData/README.md) directory for how to create harms test data

In both cases, you will need to install
- Python (3.11 or higher, except 3.13)
- Poetry (`pip install poetry`)
