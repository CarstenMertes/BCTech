# AI test data generation

The material in this sample shows how to use [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) to create test data for quality and harms tests in Business Central.

See

- the [QualityData](QualityData/structured-data-generation/README.md) directory for how to create test data for quality (e.g., accuracy) tests
- the [HarmsData](HarmsData/README.md) directory for how to create harms test data

In both cases, you will need to install
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (version 3.11 or higher, except 3.13)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (version 2.0.1 or higher; `pip install poetry`)
